      <h4>Nowadays, we use AI in many things. For example, two weeks ago, I asked AI for information about a scientist, and it provided me with a lot of information, including her family, age, picture, places where she studied, and a complete biography. I googled her and apparently, she isn't real!</h4></div>

            <h4>In our project We've created a database of articles where their truthfulness is unknown; they're not labeled as true or false. Some of these articles are true, and some are false. You can view them in the gallery page. We use a function called 'check' to calculate the likelihood of an article being true. This function includes checking the date, verifying information through Google, and using AI tools.</h4></div>
